# Magnetic_data

This repository provides experimental magnetic data, organized as follows:

- **INS_SW_MC**: Contains details of exchange interactions derived from fitting inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data to spin-wave (SW) theory for over 70 magnetic compounds. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulation data for each compound, generated using [ESpinS](https://github.com/nafiserb/ESpinS), is included.

- **FM** *(coming soon)*: Will include Curie temperature data for approximately 3,000 ferromagnetic compounds.

- **AFM** *(coming soon)*: Will include NÃ©el temperature data for approximately 3,000 antiferromagnetic compounds.
